    <h3>Why is it named Sir65?</h3>
    The name Sir65 comes from a caravan at Camping Mediterraneo in Italy, <b>caravan Maxi Sirio number 65</b>. This was the caravan of me and my friends on
        one of the craziest holidays of my life. We hung out with the young people on the camping there (I was 19 years old), and went to the bar a lot. But before we went to the bar 
        every evening we wanted to drink and have a good time at someone's place, that place was our caravan.

    <p>
        At one point it became a standard thing, drinking and having a good time at Sirio65. So at this point, Sirio65, or Sir65 was a place
        where everyone came to to have a good time, share a good laugh, and good music every evening. I still to this day try to recreate that place, only in a website environment. Without
        the music of course, that would be illegal as f*ck, but still.

    <h3>I listened to the internet to make the best possible website</h3>
    <p>
        When i was about 15 years old and up, I started to watch LOLpics, 9GAG and Reddit and enjoyed it a lot. I also observed the community, what does the community like,
        what does the community dislike? Here are some memes <b>YOU GUYS</b> made which I worked hard on to make your wish come true.
